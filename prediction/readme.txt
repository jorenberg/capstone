Introduction
------------
Predictive modelling is the process of creating, testing and validating a model to best predict the probability of an outcome, by leveraging mainly statistics. Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modelling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred.
