Introduction
------------
Predictive modelling is the process of creating, testing and validating a model to best predict the probability of an outcome, by leveraging mainly statistics. Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modelling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred.

For example, predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place. In many cases the model is chosen on the basis of detection theory to try to guess the probability of an outcome given a set amount of input data, for example given an e-mail determining how likely that it is "spam". Depending on definitional boundaries, predictive modelling is synonymous with, or largely overlapping with, the field of machine learning, as it is more commonly referred to in academic or research and development contexts. When deployed commercially, predictive modelling is often referred to as predictive analytics.

Note: A number of modeling methods from machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistics are available in predictive analytics.

Predictive Models
-----------------
Nearly any regression model can be used for prediction purposes. Broadly speaking, there are two classes of predictive models: parametric and non-parametric. Parametric models make “specific assumptions with regard to one or more of the population parameters that characterize the underlying distribution(s)”, while non-parametric regressions make fewer assumptions than their parametric counterparts. A third class, semi-parametric models, includes features of both.

Algorithms
----------
The goal of selecting and fitting a predictive algorithm is to achieve the best possible performance. Achieving performance goals involves three factors: (1) complexity of the problem, (2) complexity of the algorithmic model employed, and (3) the amount as well as richness of the data available.
