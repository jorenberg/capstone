## Capstone®
This Capstone®, is a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) Prediction Application, build with joint collaboration of [The Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), USA and in cooperation with [SwiftKey](https://swiftkey.com/en/), Inc.

## The Objective
The goal of this application is to create a data product to highlight the <b>prediction algorithm</b> that I have built and finally, to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. This Shiny App, can accepts an ```n-gram``` and predicts the <b>"next word"</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, driven by an efficient and smart prediction algorithm.
