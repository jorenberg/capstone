## Capstone®
This Capstone®, is a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) Prediction Application, build with joint collaboration of [The Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), USA and in cooperation with [SwiftKey](https://swiftkey.com/en/), Inc.

## The Objective
The goal of this application is to create a data product to highlight the <b>prediction algorithm</b> that I have built and finally, to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. This Shiny App, can accepts an ```n-gram``` and predicts the <b>"next word"</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, driven by an efficient and smart prediction algorithm.

## Project Overview
Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. [SwiftKey](https://swiftkey.com/en/), Inc. i.e., the corporate partner in this Capstone®, builds a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on their mobile devices.

One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is <b>Predictive Text Models</b>, based on Statistics, Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
