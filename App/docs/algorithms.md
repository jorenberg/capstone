## Algorithms for Capstone®.
The Heart of Capstone®, <i>i.e.</i>, Shiny Prediction Application is an efficient and smart <b>prediction algorithm</b>, driven by Statistics, Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

The driving force of this project is; Understanding the Problem (including Data Mining techniques), Exploratory Data Analysis and Modelling (including Profanity Filtering and Sampling), Prediction Model by using the ```n-gram``` and ```back-off models```, and Evaluation of the build model for efficiency & accuracy by using different metrics like perplexity, accuracy at the ```uni-gram```, ```bi-gram```, and ```tri-gram```.
