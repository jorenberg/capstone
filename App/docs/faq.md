## FAQs
<b>Q1.: What is Computational linguistics?</b>

<b>Ans:</b> Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective.

<b>Q2.: What is Natural language processing?</b>

<b>Ans:</b>
Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humanâ€“computer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve natural language understanding, that is, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input, and others involve natural language generation.

<b>Q3.: What is n-gram?</b>

<b>Ans:</b>
In the fields of computational linguistics and probability, an n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n-items from a given sequence of text or speech. The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application. The n-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus.

An n-gram of size 1 is referred to as a "unigram"; size 2 is a "bigram" (or, less commonly, a "digram"); and size 3 is a "trigram".

<b>Q4.: What is Predictive modeling?</b>

<b>Ans:</b>
Predictive modeling is the process of creating, testing and validating a model to best predict the probability of an outcome.
