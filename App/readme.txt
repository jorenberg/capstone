Introduction
------------
Shiny Prediction App: Shiny, http://shiny.rstudio.com/; is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications (apps) straight from R. The goal of this application is to create a data product to highlight the prediction algorithm that I have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. This Shiny app, can take an input as a phrase (multiple words) through a "text box" and outputs a prediction of the "next word".

Algorithms
----------
The driving force of this project is; Understanding the Problem (including Data Mining techniques), Exploratory Data Analysis and Modelling (including Profanity Filtering and Sampling), Prediction Model by using the n-gram and back-off models, and Evaluation of the build model for efficiency & accuracy by using different metrics like perplexity, accuracy at the uni-gram, bi-gram, and tri-gram.
